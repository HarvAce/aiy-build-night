# aiy-build-night

This repo is the one-stop-shop for anything do-it-yourself artificial intelligence (AIY) build night.

## Hardware

There are two different kits that can be used: a voice kit and a camera kit. If you would like to bring your build home with you, you need to prepurchase the kit from any vendor. Also, if you would like to work with the camera kit, you should plan to prepurchase, as there will only be a few available.

## Software

You will need to install software on your personal laptop in order to communicate with your kit.
The following steps need to be completed to be able to communicate and work with each kit:

- Install the VNC Viewer application in order for your laptop to communicate with the Raspberry PI boards
